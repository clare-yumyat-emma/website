                <p> Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans
                    multiple genres and her narrative songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical
                    praise and widespread media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville,
                    Tennessee, at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music
                    Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut
                    album made her the first female country singer to write or co-write a US platinum-certified album entirely
                    Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover
                    (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and
                    alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles "Cardigan" and "Willow" topped the Hot
                    100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in
                    2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)"
                    became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her tenth album Midnights (2022) and its single "Anti-Hero" broke
                    numerous streaming records. Swift has self-directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film
                    (2021), and had supporting roles in others.

                    Swift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's "Love Story"
                    and "You Belong with Me" were the first country songs to top the US pop and all-genre airplay charts,
                    respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first
                    Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and eschewed her country image
                    in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and
                    "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look
                    What You Made Me Do".
                    Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. She is
                    the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 11
                    Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard
                    Music Awards; and 84 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100
                    Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity
                    100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists'
                    rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singer-songwriters.
