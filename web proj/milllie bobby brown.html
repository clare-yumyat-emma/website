    <h3>Early Life</h3>

She moved with her family back to England when she was four, settling in Bournemouth; when she was eight, the family moved to Orlando, Florida.

    <h3> 
        Personal life 
    </h3> 
    <p> 
        Brown came into the public eye at age 12 after being cast in Stranger Things. At age 14, homophobic quotes, falsely attributed to Brown, circulated on social media in meme form which made her eventually quit Twitter because of the harassment. In addition to online bullying, she has also faced social media users and articles sexualizing her.She became frustrated with the experiences, and captioned a 2020 Instagram post on her 16th birthday with the comment "There are moments I get frustrated from the inaccuracy, inappropriate comments, sexualization, and unnecessary insults that ultimately have resulted in pain and insecurity for me." After Brown turned 18 in February 2022, her social media profiles began to be flooded by sexually explicit material from users. 
Since 2021, Brown has been in a relationship with actor Jake Bongiovi, son of musician Jon Bon Jovi.
She is an online student at Purdue University studying health and human services as of August 2022.
